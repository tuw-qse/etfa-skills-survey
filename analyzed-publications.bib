The automation of these processes promises significant cost savings as well as the required transparency and quality of the results. Biological cell cultivation protocols are constantly being researched and modified, which enormously increases the flexibility requirements for the plant technology. An important aspect is the early consideration of different laboratory equipment and the possibility of step-by-step partial automation of biological processes. In the course of process development and automation, it helps that manually executed process parts can be transparently integrated into the higher-level process control before they are automated using suitable laboratory equipment. Furthermore, device failures can be replaced by manual process execution. This paper presents a method for mapping biological skills using OPC UA models and integrating them into automated plants.},

The recently proposed control architectures target, among other plug-and-produce features, a reduction of configuration times. This is relevant for building a new production line as well as for faster reconfiguration when adding new hardware and product variants to an existing manufacturing line. This paper identifies operational requirements for such reconfiguration scenarios and proposes a way to implement them using the concept of a device adapter. The device adapter contains a device description and constantly updates it following the reconfiguration changes happening in a manufacturing system. This allows not only to detect the changes in the hardware, which appear in the production system, using the device discovery mechanisms but also automatically adapt the software. Preliminary tests have been performed on a demonstrator that shows both virtual and physical executions combined in a single system. The proposed solution supports automatic hardware and software reconfiguration on-the-fly without a need to stop and restart the whole production system.},

Within this work, the skill-based architecture is compared to a more traditional component-based hierarchical approach to identify strength and weakness of this approach, which then enables further improvements of the skill-based architecture. The flexibility of control software can not directly be measured. Therefore execution time, modularity, readability, and reusability considering the impact of component exchanges are used as evaluation criteria. Modularity and reusability are measured by the number of needed Function Blocks (FBs) and that can also be used for other systems respectively. To evaluate readability three derived metrics from the basic Halstead Metric are used. The comparison shows that the skill-based architecture is more complex but much more flexible than the more traditional component-based hierarchical approach.},

To keep the software complexity at an acceptable level and save time for development and subsequent maintenance, new solutions are sorely needed. In this paper, we investigate the advantages of using skills - universal control device interfaces - for generating complex logic in distributed control environments. By enriching a skill interface with the information about the dynamic behavior of a component under control, we compose the functionalities of individual control devices. The logic, required for such composition, is automatically derived from the interface description and the production plan, identifying the required skill sequence. The evaluation, executed using two industrial demonstrators, shows that the approach successfully handles different behavioral models and is capable of generating fault-tolerant orchestrators, including error handling scenarios. Overall, for developing a complex logic in a distributed skill-based automation system, the proposed approach shows significant savings in development time allowing to automate the skill composition task.},

This search needs to address customers’ demands and preferences such as cost-effectiveness, energy-consumption, durability, working space, etc. Consequently, solutions may comprise different products of different providers. This leads to an enormous search space of diverse potential solutions. As of today, the search process involves human effort. Thus, a good understanding of system engineering is required not only on the manufacturer side but on the customer side as well. Furthermore, integration and configuration of the products into a functional system needs extra effort.In this paper, we present our first ideas on reducing the complexity of this search task. Our approach is laid out in three layers: (i) a customer only needs to describe their desired automation application on an abstract level. (ii) manufacturers need to categorize their products as per functionality and characteristics. (iii) the linking between the requirements as per customer’s description to relevant products is done automatically.This paper provides a roadmap for the research necessary to implement these three layers in practice. We lay out the essential research questions and provide a conceptual division of the work, thus pointing out the challenges that need to be solved to allow for further automation in this area.},

Companies have to find a way to efficiently manage the production of all variants by having rapidly adaptable manufacturing resources.

Such a model can facilitate the production planning and reconfiguration process, as production requests can be quickly analyzed by the usage of the model. In addition, the model can be utilized to generate new configurations, which match the changing requirements. Accordingly, this contribution presents an approach for the modeling of manufacturing resource capabilities. The approach aims at providing an efficient basis for the matching of production requests and resource capabilities. Furthermore, the capability model should enable a change analyses for the adaptation of the resources, in order to quickly adjust them to the changing requirements. The proposed capability model has been implemented in AutomationML and XML, which allows a machine-interpretable representation of the model in a neutral data format. The applicability of the approach is demonstrated by a case study of an industrial high-voltage testing machine.},

This article proposes a capability-based operation and engineering approach to tackle the syntactic and semantic interoperability problems in flexible production lines.

In this paper, we present challenges and quality criteria that we identified with domain experts at a large Production Systems Engineering (PSE) company.

In addition to flexibly switching between different setups, the resulting schedules still have to be optimal to a certain extent to stay profitable. In this paper, we extend a capability-based planning approach to generate timed automata models that are used to solve the scheduling problem. The capability-based approach automatically generates an action sequence that defines all necessary production resources and operations for a product. The action sequence is then automatically transformed into models in UPPAAL - a model-checker for timed automata - and used to generate a schedule for production orders. The result can then be executed on the different production resources.

But the creation of such an ontological description is an additional, tedious and error-prone task for a machine developer who might most likely not be an expert in semantic web technologies. In order to support developers in implementing machine function-alities as semantically described skills, we developed a method that highly automates all additional ontology-related tasks. The presented method makes use of information already contained in engineering artifacts, helps in adding additional information, and provides a framework to implement skill behavior. By using the proposed method, machine developers are put in a position to develop formal capability models themselves and with little additional effort.},

  abstract  = {Cyber physical production systems (CPPS) focus on increasing the flexibility and adaptability of industrial production systems, systems that comprise hardware such as sensors and actuators in machines as well as software controlling and integrating these machines. The requirements of customised mass production imply that control and integration software needs to be adaptable after deployment in a shop floor (factory), possibly even without interrupting production. Today, software frameworks provide support to model and execute manufacturing processes. They, however, provide little support for reuse. In this paper, we present a framework based on capabilities, which supports manufacturing process templates. These templates are bound/allocated to a specific shopfloor setup, a specific set of machines, and executed using a distributed set of process engines. This enables the reuse of manufacturing processes, as well as transmitting and executing changed processes. The framework is implemented using the Eclipse Milo implementation of OPC UA in Java. It is used to control a lab-scale modular shopfloor programmed in IEC61499 and Java.},

  abstract  = {Optimal selection of resources for a Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) has a strong potential to reduce the cost of producing product families. Unfortunately, engineers rarely have specific methods and tools to represent their expert knowledge for applying mathematical optimization approaches. Representing this knowledge requires capabilities to model the dependencies between products, production processes, resources, skills, and their variability. In this paper, we provide these capabilities and focus on improving CPPS resource selection by defining aggregated requirements of a set of similar processes for resources. We illustrate the industrial use case Car Body with Screwed-on Parts on defining requirements for resource candidates suitable for a set of screwing process variants. We introduce the Product-Process-Resource-Skill & Variability (PPRS+V) method for consistently designing aggregated Product-Process-Resource (PPR) skills required for optimal CPPS resource selection as foundation for engineering support. We introduce the Skill Aggregation algorithm to efficiently aggregate the skills for a process step required to produce a product family. In an initial feasibility study, domain experts found the PPRS+V method and the Skill Aggregation algorithm usable and useful.},

Second, there is a natural tendency to define very generic skills to capture all possible use cases. But at some point, skills have to be translated into precise instructions for execution. The model makes this dichotomy explicit and provides a common taxonomy for stakeholders concerned with skills on different abstraction levels.},

Many existing machine tools, handling and logistics systems are already generic and not bound to a specific product a-priori. Yet this flexibility and reconfigurability on the asset level is lost in automated systems that are limited to executing a small set of predefined actions in a fixed sequence. The SkillPro1 project aims to develop a holistic service-oriented framework for modelling and orchestration of modern adaptable manufacturing systems. The core concept is a unified abstraction for manufacturing tasks: skills provided by the available assets and the requirements of the different production steps. The skill-based system model enables the transition from generic high-level descriptions to low-level formats that can be directly executed. Self-describing assets can be added, changed and removed at runtime, taking into account technical and economic conditions to best achieve the manufacturing goals.},

We hereby focus on the reusability of the skills for many different domains. The model is evaluated by controlling three different industrial robots and their tools through the same skill interface. The evaluation shows that our generic OPC UA skill model can be used as a standardized control interface for device and software components in industrial manufacturing. With our solution new components can easily be exchanged without changing the interface. This is not only true for industrial robots, but for any device which provides a controllable functionality.},

This paper aims to close this gap by introducing the Risk-Aware Bin Picking Configuration (RABPC) model on sub-system configurations and their dependencies to quality characteristics of the IBPA. In the RABPC model, a configuration matrix represents the involved sub-systems, and a Product-Process-Resource-Skill (PPRS) Network describes quality dependencies of library components to reduce the risk of deficient applications.

These instructions are then used to visually program the robot setup by blocks, which contain functionality ranging from point-to-point motions to high-level skills. These "Skillblocks" allow for a seamless transition between execution in the simulation environment and on the physical robot through interchangeable execution layers in the software architecture. The system also allows for feedback from a physical execution to be monitored in real-time and fed back to the simulation environment for processing.The aim of the system is to close the gap between digital and physical workcells when integrating robot solutions. This increases intuitiveness and allows for process monitoring and optimization through direct feedback to the digital model.},

  abstract  = {Current trends in the context of Industry 4.0 attempt to minimize production costs and increase productivity. Nowadays control systems consist of components from various manufacturers. Therefore, it must be possible to easily connect these components without any platform specific interface definitions or software implementations. A first approach is the industry standard OPC UA, which enables the definition of hardware-independent interfaces of automation components (i.e. PLCs). Many manufacturers already start to integrate this standard into their products but unfortunately it only defines the transport layer of data and not which data is to be transported. Therefore, vendor-overlapping communication is only possible in case there is common understanding of how variables and functions are named and interpreted. A promising step towards this is to define skills as atomic unit for modeling and operating automation processes. Consequently the fixed mapping of skills and manufacturing stations is no more necessary during the engineering process. When applying skill-based engineering concepts it is only important to model and orchestrate skills that can accomplish the required tasks. The mapping between required and available skills can be done on the fly. Accordingly in this paper we propose an OPC UA-based multi-layered approach to orchestrate and execute manufacturing workflows using production task-based skills operated on flexibly linked and different hardware components (i.e. manufacturing stations).},

One phase in this planning process is the selection of suitable automation resources to carry out an assembly step. The concept presented in this paper aims to support this selection process. Therefore, the requirements of the production process are modelled and generated based on the product model. The resources, on the other hand, provide assurances to be matched within the selection process. These requirements and assurances are modelled generically and product-oriented without using a process taxonomy or ontology.
